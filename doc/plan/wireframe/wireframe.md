##### Example 1

Here, we can see that the user has written the correct commands
and has run them. The result can be seen both on the Turtle Graphics
Window and History Window.

The faded triangle shows the original position of the turtle and the
solid white triangle shows the updated position of the turtle with the
white line showing the trace of the movement of the turtle, since pendown
has been called.

##### Example 2

Here, we can see that the user has written an incorrect command
and has run it. Given the incorrect 'forward' command, the turtle hasn't
moved. However, all commands until the incorrect command have been recorded
in the History Window.

Additionally, a red box indicating the error has appeared on the
screen relaying the information about the incorrect command.

##### Example 3

Here, we can see that the user has written the correct commands
and has run them. The result can be seen both on the Turtle Graphics
Window and History Window.

Additionally, we can see that the comment has been correctly not
recognized as a command, thus not reflected in the History Window
or the behavior of the turtle.

Furthermore, the 'make' command has successfully assigned the value
100 to the variable x. As we have toggled to the 'User-defined Variables'
window in the lower left corner of the screen, we can see the variable and
its value recorded.

The faded triangle shows the original position of the turtle and the
solid white triangle shows the updated position of the turtle with the
white line showing the trace of the movement of the turtle, since pendown
has been called.

##### Example 4

Here, we can see that the user has written a correct command
but with incorrect number of parameters. Given the incorrect number of parameters
for the 'forward' command, the turtle hasn't moved. However, all commands until the
command with the incorrect number of parameters have been recorded in the History Window.

Additionally, a red box indicating the error has appeared on the
screen relaying the information about the incorrect number of parameters
for the command while indicating the correct number of parameters necessary.
